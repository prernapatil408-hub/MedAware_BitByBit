MedAware
Beyond simple reminders, our AI-driven visual verification ensures medication is actually taken, not just dismissed. Bridging the gap between care and Adherence Assurance with 60-day adherence reports for your loved ones.
    
📌 Overview
MedAware is an AI-powered medication adherence platform designed to move beyond passive reminders and introduce real-world Adherence Assurance. While traditional apps simply sound an alarm that can be easily dismissed, MedAware ensures patient safety by requiring visual verification through a built-in computer vision model.

Our solution bridges the communication gap between elderly patients and their families. By categorizing doses as Verified, Not Verified, or Missed, we provide caregivers with a data-driven 60-day health report, ensuring that "dismissing an alarm" actually translates to "taking the medicine."
    
✨ Key Features

🤖 AI-Powered "Visual Proof" Verification
Unlike standard reminder apps that can be blindly dismissed, MedAware introduces Adherence Assurance through Computer Vision.

Automatic Frame Capture: When an alarm is dismissed, the app automatically activates the camera to scan for the user and the medication.

Intelligent Status Labeling: 
Verified: AI confirms both the user's face and the medicine in a single frame.

Not Verified: The alarm was dismissed, but the AI could not confirm the medicine was present.

Missed: The alarm was ignored entirely.

📊 Comprehensive Adherence Reporting
Bridge the communication gap between elderly parents and their children with data-driven insights.

Long-term Tracking: View detailed history for the past 30 or 60 days.

Family Transparency: Caregivers can see exactly how many doses were actually verified versus those just dismissed.

Visual Logs: Access the stored "Verified" frames to confirm medication was taken as prescribed.

📅 Smart Medication Management
A complete workflow from registration to restocking.

Detailed Reminders: Input medicine name, total stock quantity, and specific dose amounts.

Inventory Alerts: A few days before your supply runs out, MedAware triggers a Restock Alert.

Doctor Integration: Proactive prompts to book your next appointment before your current prescription expires.

👤 Personalized Health Profiles
Secure onboarding that captures essential vitals (Age, Weight, Height, Gender) to ensure all reminders are contextualized to the specific user's health needs.
